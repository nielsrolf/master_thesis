- whats an autoencoder
- aes are interesting if their latent space uncovers interesting features of the signal
- they have been applied to various domains 
- can be used for anomaly detection, as a pretraining task, for compression, or as a low-level module for a generative task (jukebox, dalle)
- this work: builds on DDSP autoencoder
    - ddsp is efficient due to induced bias
    - used on monophonic (harmonic) instrument recordings
    - ddsp allows interesting transformations such as timbre transfer
    - ddsp could potentially be used as a low-level module for downstream applications
        - generative tasks (replace vq-vae of jukebox)
        - audio source separation
- this work is two folded: 1) improving the baseline model, 2) evaluating transfer learning

transfer learning
- usually used to transfer knowledge from one task to another
- here: transfer to any inference task
- this still allows timbre transfer, source separation, and can be used for generative tasks
