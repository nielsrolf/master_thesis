# Baseline

Findings:
- How well does the harmonic noise synthesizer reconstruct different types of sound?
Drums:
    - most sounds pretty recognizable, but poor sound quality
    5/10    0.373   0.385
URMP:
    - urmp test also recognizable but some sound off. Cello reconstruction sounds somewhat like a trumpet. Flute and violin are mostly good
    5/10    4.875   0.316
    - guitar and bass reconstructions are not recognizable as a guitar
    2/10    7.7     0.563
    - drums are completely off
    0/10    7.921   0.729
    - sh101 does not sound like a synth, sounds like some kind of instrument
    2/10    11.7    1.09
SH101:
    - sh101 test: very accurate reconstruction, sounds good
    8/10    5.989   0.493



- Is z an encoding for the timbre of an instrument which is constant over time
    - All transfers sound super off
    - filtered noise is very dominant
    - squeaky sounds appear
    - cycle reconstruction: original instrument not recognizable, loud filtered noise, squeaky sounds appear in silent parts


# Time average

Reconstruction capability:
    - URMP 5/10 roughly the same as baseline, maybe even a bit better
    - bass: 2/10 similar as baseline
Timbre transfer capability: improved a lot on URMP, did not improve on bass or guitar
Cycle reconstruction: timbre captured much better, but loud squeaky artifacts remain

# New loudness
- New loudness better at reconstructing cello urmp_test/audio_original sample 6
- cycle reconstruction 1: much better trumpet reconstruction, less filtered noise, less squeaky sounds
- show cycle reconstruction image

# Unskewed Spectral Loss
- show the same cycle reconstruction image (better score than spectral loudness)
- no qualitive difference in subjective listening evaluation

# Time Aggregation
average ~ confidence, groupwise sounds a bit better

# No CREPE:
everything sounds like nonsense
